The radar chart illustrates deposit trends in Qatar from 2018 to 2019, categorizing deposits into Total Deposits, Public Sector Deposits, Private Sector Deposits, and Non-Resident Deposits. The Total Deposits consistently remain the highest, while Private Sector Deposits and Public Sector Deposits show relatively similar trends. Non-Resident Deposits remain the lowest throughout the period, indicating limited foreign deposit contributions. The overall structure suggests that the Qatari banking system relies heavily on domestic deposits, particularly from the private and public sectors.
