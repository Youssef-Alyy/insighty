The line chart illustrates trends in money supply and currency issuance in Qatar from 2018 to 2024. The three key money supply measures—Money Supply 1 (M1), Money Supply 2 (M2), and Money Supply 3 (M3)—show different growth patterns. M3 is the highest and has seen a steady increase, reflecting overall liquidity in the economy. M2 follows a similar upward trend but at a lower scale, while M1 remains relatively stable with slight fluctuations. Currency issued remains the lowest and exhibits minimal variation over time, indicating controlled physical cash circulation. The increasing gap between M3 and M2 suggests rising financial instruments and broader liquidity growth in the economy.
