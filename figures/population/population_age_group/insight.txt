The graph presents Qatarâ€™s monthly population distribution across different age groups from 2018 to 2024. The dataset includes four categories: individuals aged less than 15, 15-24, 25-64, and more than 65. The population of the 25-64 age group remained the highest, followed by the less than 15 group. The data shows seasonal fluctuations, with notable dips around early 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a strong recovery afterward. The 65+ population experienced a steady increase, reflecting demographic aging trends. Policy changes, economic factors, and migration patterns likely contribute to these fluctuations.
