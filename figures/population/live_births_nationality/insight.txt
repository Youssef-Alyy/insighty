 The graph represents the monthly statistics of live births in Qatar from 2018 to 2024, categorized by nationality and gender. Non-Qatari females had the highest number of births, showing an overall increasing trend. A significant drop occurred around 2020, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a recovery and growth. Qatari males and females had relatively stable birth rates, while non-Qatari males followed a similar trend to their female counterparts but with lower values. The fluctuations suggest that external factors such as policy changes, economic conditions, and migration trends influence birth rates in Qatar.
