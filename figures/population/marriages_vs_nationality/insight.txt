The graph illustrates the monthly number of marriages in Qatar from 2018 to 2023, categorized by nationality and gender. The dataset includes Qatari males, Qatari females, non-Qatari males, and non-Qatari females. A sharp decline in marriages is evident in early 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by a rapid increase, suggesting a post-pandemic recovery. The trend for Qatari marriages is significantly higher compared to non-Qataris. Fluctuations in marriage numbers may be influenced by cultural factors, economic conditions, and governmental policies on residency and citizenship.
