The trends in traffic violations reveal key patterns influenced by major events in Qatar. The sharp decline in early 2020 aligns with the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, where reduced mobility led to a drastic drop in violations, particularly in overspeeding. As restrictions eased, traffic violations gradually increased, reflecting the return of normal road activity. A significant surge in late 2022 coincides with the FIFA World Cup, which brought an influx of visitors and heightened road congestion, likely contributing to more violations due to increased enforcement and stricter regulations. The continued rise in 2023 and early 2024 suggests a combination of higher road usage, evolving traffic policies, and advancements in monitoring technologies, reinforcing the need for adaptive enforcement strategies and AI-driven traffic management solutions.
