The dataset provides an analysis of traffic accident statistics across Qatari municipalities from 2020 onward, highlighting key trends in fatalities, injuries, and total incidents. Al Rayyan and Al Khor and Al Thakhira report the highest accident figures, with most incidents resulting in minor injuries rather than fatalities. Higher population density and urban congestion contribute to increased accident rates, with seasonal fluctuations also playing a role. If left unaddressed, accident rates may continue to rise in urban areas, but targeted safety measures, stricter regulations, and infrastructure improvements could mitigate these risks. Machine learning and AI-driven predictive models can enhance road safety by identifying high-risk zones and optimizing response strategies, enabling authorities to take proactive measures in reducing traffic incidents across Qatar.
