## Project Overview

Insighty is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide in-depth insights and predictions across various sectors in Qatar. Qatar's rapid growth has led to a wealth of data in domains like traffic, environment, population, finance, trade, and properties. 
Insighty tackles the challenge of extracting meaningful insights from these datasets, offering a user-friendly way to explore patterns, trends, and correlations.

At its core, Insighty integrates an AI chatbot with interactive heatmaps and data visualizations. This combination empowers users to analyze and discuss complex data intuitively.

## Technical Implementation

Insighty's architecture comprises several key components:

* **AI Chatbot:** Developed using Next.js to provide an intuitive conversational experience for data exploration. 
* **Interactive Heatmap and Visualization Dashboard:** Utilizes D3.js and Recharts for dynamic charts and interactive heatmaps. 
* **Database Integration and Predictive Analytics:** A robust database stores historical data, enabling predictive modeling.
